# PocPlot

A simple GTK3/GObject graph plotting library.

This project was born from the need for making some nice looking plots in
another project I was working on.  Many years ago I had used the plotting
facilities from GtkExtra but this module was never ported to GTK3.  Having
looked into porting the GtkExtra modules from GTK2 I decided it was too complex
a task, given my requirements, so I started looking around for something else.
I found Goat Plot but this had issues with recent GTK3. However it was almost
what I wanted. Ultimately after a false start at fixing the issues there I
decided to sketch out some ideas and write my own.

PocPlot is the result of that effort. I've been using this with no problems
other than occasional bug-fixes for about ten months at the time of writing
(September 2020).

# xslt-extra

A collection of libxslt extension modules.

This is a collection of libxslt extensions I have used over the years with
libxslt.  It was about time I collected them together, gave them a really
imaginative name, and published them with a proper build system and
documentation (as much for my own benefit, I wrote some of this years ago and
memory fades).
